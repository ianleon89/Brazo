Code Red Technologies RDB1768 Board - HostStringsDemo
=====================================================

[ Note that this project requires the CMSISv2p00_LPC17xx library 
  project to exist in the same workspace. ]

This project is designed to show how the Host Strings functionality
of "Red Trace" within Red Suite 4 can be used to display diagnostic
messages as your code is running.

The project is based on the RDB1768cmsis2_SysTick example, with
three Host String outputs added:

HS_DisplayVal - used to periodically output the value of 'msticks'
HS_LedsOn     - used to print a diagnostic when LEDs switch on
HS_LedsOff()  - used to print a diagnostic when LEDs switch on

For more details on using Host Strings and other Red Trace 
functionality, see the "Getting Started with Red Trace" Guide 
provided with Red Suite 4.

Note that this example project is intended for use with Red Suite v4.0
or later. Note that Red Trace functionality is not available within
the LPCXpresso IDE.
